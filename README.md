The system requires the admin to set up the modules, intakes, classes, classrooms, students and lecturers.
After the admin finish setting up everything, the lecturers can start taking the attendance by selecting the class, the duration and classroom.
When taking the attendance, the system will display a scanable QR code.
Students will need to scan the QR code and login to receive the attendance.
The attendance will only be taken if the student is in range of the classroom and if the student is on time.
In case of any problem the lecturers can manually take the students' attendance.
